# My Node.js Project

## Description

This project is a Node.js application that connects to a MongoDB database to manage student records. It provides various endpoints to interact with the student data, including retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting student records.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [(https://github.com/Ahmet-Acik/mongodbschoolnodejs.git)]
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create a `.env` file** (if your project uses environment variables):
    ```plaintext
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/school
    PORT=3000
    ```

5. **Initialize the database**:
    Create a `init-db.js` script to set up your database and collections (optional but recommended). See [Database Initialization](#database-initialization) for more details.

6. **Run the project**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
